# Assuming no delays, the distance that a car travels down the interstate can be calculated with the following formula:
# Distance = Speed X Time

print ("This program is calculating miles traveled by an automobile traveling at a set speed for a certain number of hours")

#variable one is the speed traveled

speed = 70

# Variable two is distance after 6 hours

DistanceAfter6 = speed * 6

# Variable three is distance ater 10 hours

distanceAfter10 = speed * 10

# Variable four is distance after 15 hours

distanceAfter15 = speed * 15

# Distance after 6 hours
